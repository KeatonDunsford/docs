# Setup your urbit

By default your urbit is quite bare-bones. Let's get setup quickly.

### Filesystem — `%clay`

`%clay`, the Urbit filesystem, isn't mounted to unix by default. In the `:dojo` prompt, run:

    ~fitund-macrep:dojo> |mount %

This should produce:

    > |mount %
    >=

which indicates the command was processed.

`|mount %` will cause a `home/` directory to appear inside your pier
folder. Changes to these files are automatically synced into your urbit.

### Messaging — `:talk`

Use `ctrl-x` to change your prompt. Let's join the main Urbit chat
channel.

For planets:

    ~fitund-macrep:talk() ;join /urbit-meta

For comets:

    ~ticlen_nimder:talk() ;join ~samzod/urbit-meta

`:talk` is stateful, so your urbit will download a backlog.
`/urbit-meta` is the place to ask questions, get help and talk about
anything Urbit-related.

### Web — `:tree`

Urbit is also accessible through the web. Try opening:

    http://localhost:8443/

in your favorite browser. You'll be prompted to use `+code`. This page
was generated by `:tree`, the basic Urbit web interface. You can also
access your urbit through `http://fintud-macrep.urbit.org` (where
`fintud-macrep` is your planet name).
